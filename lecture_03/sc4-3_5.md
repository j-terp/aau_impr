What value is assigned to the type int variable ans in this statement if the value of `p` is 100 and `q` is 50?

ans = (p > 95) + (q < 95)

This statement is not shown as an example of a reasonable assignment statement; rather, it is a sample of a statement that makes little sense to the reader. The statement is still legal and executable in C, however, because C uses integers to represent the logical values true and false.
