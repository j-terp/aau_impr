Evaluate each of the following expressions if `a` is 6, `b` is 9 `c` is 14 and `flag` is 1. Which parts of these expressions are not evaluated due to short-circuit evaluation?

  ```console
  (c == a + b) == 0
  (0 || !flag) == 0
  ```

  > Result: False
  
  ```console
  (a != 7) == 1
  (1 && flag) == 1
  1 || c >= 6 is not evaluated, short-circuit evaluation to true
  ```

  > Result: True

  ```console
  (b <= 12) == 1
  !1 == 0
  0 && a % 2 == 0 is not evaluated, short-circuit evaluation to false
  ```

  >Result: False

  ```console
  (a > 5) == 1
  1 || c < a + b is not evaluated, short-circuit evaluation to true
  !1 == 0
  ```

  > Result: False
