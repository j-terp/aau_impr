# Programming Project exercise 11 (ch. 2)

The Pythagorean theorem states that the sum of two squares of the sides of a right triangle is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. For example, if two sides of a right triangle have lengths of 3 and 4, then the hypotenuse must have the length of 5. Together the integers 3, 4 and 5 form a *Pythagorean triple*. There are an infinite number of such triples. Given two positive integers, `m` and `n` where `m > n`, a Pythagorean triple can be generated by the following formulas:

- `side1 = m^2 - n^2`
- `side2 = 2mn`
- `hypotenuse = m^2 + n^2`

The triple (side1 = 3, side2 = 4, and hypotenuse = 5) is generated by this formula when `m = 2` and `n = 1`. Write a program that takes values fot m and n as input and displays the values of the Pythagorean triple generated by the formulas above.
