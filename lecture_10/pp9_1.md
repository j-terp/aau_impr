Develop a program to count pixels (picture elements) belonging to an object in a photograpth. The data are in a two-dimensional grid of cells, each of which may be empty (value 0) or filled (value 1). The filled cells that are connected form a blob (an object). Figure 9.27 shows a grid with three blobs. Include in your program a function `blob_check` that takes as parameters the grid and the `x-y` coordinates of a cell and returns as its value the number of cells in the blob to which the indicated cell belongs.

Function `blob_check` must test whether the cell specified by its arguments is filled. There are two simple cases: The cell (`x`, `y`) may not be on the grid or the cell (`x`, `y`) may be empty. In either of these cases, the value returned by `blob_check` is 0. If the cell is on the grid an dfilled, then the value returned is 1 + the size of the blobs containing each of its eight neighbours. To avoid counting a filled cell more than once, mark a cell as empty once you have counted it.
