# Programming exercise 1 (ch. 5.3)

[< Back](../README.md)

---

Write a program segment that computes `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (n - 1) + n`, where `n` is a data value. Follow the loop body with an if statement that compares this value to `(n * (n + 1)) / 2` and displays a message that indicates whether the values are the same or different. What message do you think will be displayed?
