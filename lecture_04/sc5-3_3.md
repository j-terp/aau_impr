# Self Check exercise 3 (ch. 5.3)

[< Back](../README.md)

---

The following segment needs some revision. Insert braces where they are needed and correct the errors. The corrected code should take five integers and display their sum.

```c
    count = 0;
    while (count < 5)
    count += 1;
    printf("Next number> ");
    scanf("%d", &next_num);
    next_sum += sum;
    printf("%d numbers were added; \n", count);
    printf("their sum is %d.\n", sum);
}
```
