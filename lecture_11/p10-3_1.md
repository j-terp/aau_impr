[< Back](../README.md)

---

Define a structure type to represent a common fraction. Write a program that gets a fraction and displays both the fraction and the fraction reduced to its lowest terms using the following code fragment:

```c
frac = get_fraction();
print_fraction(frac);
printf(" = ");
printf_fraction(reduce_fraction(frac));
```
