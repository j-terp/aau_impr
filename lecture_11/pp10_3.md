A number expressed in scientific notation is represented by its mantissa (a fraction) and its exponent (an integer). Define a type `sci_not_t` that has separate components for these two parts. Define a function `scan_sci` that takes from the input source a string representing a positive number in scientific notation, and breaks it into components for storage in a `sci_not_t` structure. The mantissa of an input value (`m`) should satisfy this condition `0.1 <= m < 1.0`. Also write functions to compute the sum, difference, product and quotient of two `sci_not_t` values. All these functions should have a result type of `sci_not_t` and should ensure that the result's mantissa is in the prescribed range. Define a `print_sci` function as well. Then, create a driver program to test your functions. Your output should be of this form:

```console
Values input:  0.25000e3   0.20000e1
Sum:   0.25200e3
Difference: 0.24800e3
Product:   0.50000e3
Quotioent:   0.12500e3
```
